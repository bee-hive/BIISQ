# This is the readme for the visualizaiton code
(1) The functions are coded in visualize_npb_iso.py, and the top script to wrap it is run_visualize_npb_iso.py
(2) To run it and save log file, refer to run.script. 
    The first argument is the path to the "outfile.p" of VarBayes.py code. 
    This is also the path to save the results of isoform proportions ("results.txt").
    Those results are also printed during runtime.
    The second argument is the exon length file (like in the example_exon_len.txt) for RPKM calculation.
    The third argument is a flag (0/1) to indicate if you want to plot the results for each iteration.
    The fourth argument is an integer flag (0 or 1 for now) to indicate the method to compute global and individual isoform proportion. 0 means using t or global and psi for individual.
    The fifth argument is a flag to skip plotting or not.
    The sixth argument is the flag to save html or not.
(3) An example of the script is in run.script.
